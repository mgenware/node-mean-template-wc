# node-mean-template-wc

Node.js TypeScript boilerplate for **Web components**. Based on [node-mean-template](https://github.com/mgenware/node-mean-template) with the following additions:

- `#serve`: Starts dev mode in browser
- `#t`: Browser testing via `@web/test-runner-playwright` (by default it only tests against WebKit)
- `#tw`: Browser testing with watch mode
